# Timer Challenge Game

## Overview
The **Timer Challenge Game** is an interactive web application built with React that challenges players to manage their time effectively. Players can set their names and start a timer that counts down to a target time. If they stop the timer too late, they will receive a score based on how well they managed their time.

## Features
- **Player Name Input**: Players can input their names, which will be displayed on the screen.
- **Timer Functionality**: Players can start, stop, and reset a countdown timer.
- **Score Calculation**: Players receive a score based on their performance relative to the target time.
- **Modal Display**: A modal window appears to show the result of the game when the timer runs out or when stopped.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the user interface and managing component state.
- **React Hooks**: Utilizing `useState`, `useRef`, and `useImperativeHandle` for state management and DOM manipulation.
- **CSS**: Basic styling to improve the user experience.
